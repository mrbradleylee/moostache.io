## The Basics

What is the "Stalk Market?" The basic premise is simple, buy low, sell high. Since you're here, you already know the commodity is turnips. We'll cover the basics of turnips, including tools to help you buy and sell for bells you'll run out of use for soon.

## Buying

Every Sunday, Daisy Mae, the little snot nosed fellow, will visit your paradise selling turnips in stacks of 10. The prices range from 90-110 bells per stack of 10, and are tied to your island. Feel free to visit other islands if they have better prices, but note you can ONLY buy turnips on Sunday, between the island hours of 0800-1159. She scoots on the dot.
:::warning
If you change your system clock at all when you have turnips on your island, they will rot.

## Selling

Turnips are sold at Nook's Cranny, by the sniveling little raccoons. They'll only buy turnips Monday thru Saturday, at varying prices that are set each day from M-F from 0800-1159, and change again from 1200-2200. These follow set patterns per island, which we'll get to in a bit. Turnips will rot at 0500 the following Sunday, so be sure to sell them by 2200 Saturday the week you buy them. Rotten turnips aren't entirely useless, but since we're here to make money, don't let em rot. Also, if you change your system clock, rot rot rot.

## Get Rich Quick

Taking advantage of the turnip market requires a few things, understanding the pricing patterns, and taking advantage of other people's hard work to find the best prices for buying and selling.

## Turnip Prophet

Fortunately, for us common folk, the geniuses have data mined pretty much all of the available patterns for us. We know that there are 4 patterns available for your turnip prices, which are:

```
Small Spike: caps out at around 220ish bells
Large Spike: all the way up to the 680ish
Fluctuating: caps out at 150ish
Decreasing: F
```

How do you know which pattern you're getting this week? Here's where other people's hard work comes in, with a little bit of your own due-diligence. The lovely folks at the <a href="https://turnipprophet.io" target="_blank">Turnip Prophet</a> have created a site where you can track your prices over the week, and it will reference those prices against the data mined patterns. As you enter more data, your available patterns will start to narrow down, and you can start making decisions on when you want to sell, or if you even want to sell on your island. Large spikes are obviously the desired pattern, and it helps to know when that spike is coming if you're lucky enough to get it. Your due diligence counts here, as the data accuracy is based on you knowing your prices every day. Also note that it's based on your purchase prices as well as your pattern from the week prior, so keep track of those!!

## What If My Prices Suck?

Too bad, so sad. Or, start looking for randos! This is where the second set of resources come into play, the <a href="https://turnip.exchange" target="_blank">Turnip Exchange</a>. The turnip exchange allows you to both host islands for selling your turnips (to rake in some profits if you got a large spike and want to share the wealth) or hunt for islands with high turnip prices. We'll focus on the latter here, but be aware that turnip prices over ~450 can net you a pretty profit in fees and tips if you want to go through the pain of hosting.

For selling, head to the islands and find placard that have both the prices you want, and the fees that are palatable to you. Some of it is pretty overboard these days in the 500+ range, asking for an entire stack of NMTs and furniture and gold nuggets and 10% of your turnips... Up to you if you want to contribute to that mess. If you're lucky enough to get into a queue, let the waiting game begin. Long story short, you hit the front of the line, get your DODO code, fly out and get rich!

And that's pretty much all there is to it, go get your Bellionaire title!
