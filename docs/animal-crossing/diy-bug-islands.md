***Got an excess of Nook Miles? Turn those Nook Miles into bells with some DIY bug islands. Strap in, this is a long one!!***

## Nook Miles Into Bells

There's a few ways to trade your Nook Miles to bells, from bell vouchers to straight selling tickets, which, at the time of posting are going for around 125,000 each on average. Selling tickets is the fastest way to do it, but if you don't feel like dealing with other people or taking the trading risk, DIY bug islands can turn a decent profit, with an inventory mostly full of tarantulas or scorpions netting you 300,000 plus (or 450,000 plus with Flick) on the high end, with the super lazy low end still being 80,000. Personally, I make about 150,000 on average from each island, bringing back only a third of my inventory full of the good bugs.

## What's The Catch?

See what I did there? The most lucrative bugs we can catch on these islands only spawn after 1900, which means bug islands are really only valuable at night. Also, if you're just starting, you won't have the 40 slot pockets yet either, so there's that...

## How Do I Start?

First things first, we need to get the right island. Most islands will work just fine, and some will work much better than others. Islands with three levels and/or 5 rocks on em, give those a hard pass and count yourself unlucky. Pretty much every other island will work, as long as you see bugs somewhere when you get there.

How many bells you go home with is based on time and luck. Luck being getting good bug spawns and a good layout, and time being how long you want to stay to chase the higher value bugs.

## High Value Bugs

Our bounty. We'll be targeting these main bugs, based on sell value: tarantula/scorpion at 8000 each, atlas moth at 3000, and giant water bugs at 2000. Ideally we want to bring back as many tarantulas/scorpions as possible, but random spawns mean it can take a long time to get a full inventory of them.

The main idea is to remove the spawn conditions for as many bugs as possible, so we can force these specific critters to spawn.

## Preparing The Island

Controlling the spawns means almost razing the island. Pick all the flowers, break all the rocks, chop all the trees (except the coconut), and dig up all the stumps. We leave the coconut trees for the Atlas moths to spawn on. Giant water bugs will spawn in the rivers, and tarantulas/scorpions will generally spawn on the grassy areas. There are two other bugs that will need to be cleared, tiger beetles and wharf roaches on the shore rocks. Simply running through them is enough to chase them away, and give us room for our target spawns. Water bugs are a pain though, cause the only way to clear them is to catch themâ€¦ One important thing to note here, is that if you dig up a spot, bugs won't spawn there. So for those two level islands with no waterfall, dig up that top! By removing almost everything from the island, we again limit the bugs that can spawn.

## Setting The Trap

Now to lay the trap. It's simple, draw an 'H' somewhere with your shovel. When you see a tarantula or scorpion, as you approach it, it'll go up on its legs. If you move at all during this point, it'll start chasing you, and that's the goal. Have it chase you into your clever trap, and jump through, like below. It'll get stuck on the other side, catch it, and profit.

At any point in time, you'll have a minimum of 2 bugs on your island. If it's a water bug, rip you, you have to catch it. Again, tiger beetles and roaches can just be scattered by running through em, be sure to check your coconut trees for Atlas moths as well.

I'll be sure to keep this updated as the months change, currently, in May, there are scorpions on the Northern Hemisphere, and water bugs are going to be a pain the whole summer...
