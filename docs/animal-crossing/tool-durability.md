**_All your tools are going to break, see how long each type of tool will last and decide if upgrading them is right for you._**

## Types Of Tools

At this point, you're probably already familiar with all the different tools in the game, and we'll introduce the different variations as well. All tools listed below, along with variants:

## What Consumes Durability?

Different actions consume durability in different ways for each tool, for example, hitting a rock with a flimsy axe consumes one durability, but rocks interact with tools differently than trees. If you hit a rock with one durability left on an axe, that axe won't break until the rock "timer" is up. Where as if you hit a tree with a one durability axe, it will break on the first hit. Any other activity other than what's listed will not consume durability, and brief overview of what consumes durability for each tools is below.

:::note
Vaulting poles, ladders, and wands do NOT break.
:::

```
Axe - hitting a tree or rock
Shovel - hitting a rock, digging up a stump/flower/tree
Net - catching an object
Fishing Rod - catching a fish
Watering Can - watering a flower, at a lower percentage, watering anything/nothing
Slingshot - shooting a balloon
```

## How Much Can I Expect?

Here's how many smacks each tool can take, noting that variant tools (Colorful, Outdoorsy, etc) have the same durability as the "iron" versions and do not include the Golden tools. As you can see, Golden tools outside of the watering can are largely not worth.

```
Tool: Flimsy, Variant, Golden
Axe: 40, 100, 200
Shovel: 40, 100, 200
Net: 10, 30, 90
Fishing Rod: 8-10, 30, 90
Watering Can: 20, 60, 180
Slingshot: -, 20, 60
```

## Exceptions To Note

There are a few exceptions to note, namely watering cans. The flimsy version will water a single spot, where the variant will do a 2 x 3 spot, and the golden will do a 3 x 3 spot. This is probably the only case where upgrading is a real value. Also note that some flowers can only be produced by hybrids with a gold can.

The final important note, which I haven't gotten around to seeing if they patched it out yet, is that customizing tools (with a customization kit) effectively gives you a new tool, so a shovel with 99 smacks on it will basically have the durability reset for one kit, which is 600 bells. Hope this helps!
