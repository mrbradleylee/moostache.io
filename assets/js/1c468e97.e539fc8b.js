Even in a small page static site, I already felt the pain of managing multiple static pages and the common elements across them. In the first version of this site, built entirely on HTML and CSS we started experimenting with some static generators. Since the basis was super lightweight, I settled on Sergey just for some HTML replacement sections, including the &lt;header&gt; &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; sections. This very quickly evolved (or devolved) into what we\'re looking at today."}]}')}}]);
