Selling tickets is the fastest way to do it, but if you don't feel like dealing with other people or taking the trading risk, DIY bug islands can turn a decent profit, with an inventory mostly full of tarantulas or scorpions netting you 300,000 plus (or 450,000 plus with Flick) on the high end, with the super lazy low end still being 80,000.

There are two other bugs that will need to be cleared, tiger beetles and wharf roaches on the shore rocks. Simply running through them is enough to chase them away, and give us room for our target spawns. Water bugs are a pain though, cause the only way to clear them is to catch them\xe2\u20ac\xa6 One important thing to note here, is that if you dig up a spot, bugs won't spawn there.
